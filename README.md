This project is a work in progress.

It is a simple calculator who use Function Points Analysis (by IFPUG) to estimate its size, price andtime to do and is intended to be a tool for freelancing as developer.

To install it, just clone this repository into your apache, nginx or even IIS. Whatever you use to run PHP. To run it locally, start your webserver and point your browser to localhost.
